      <p>Grace Gude is a junior software engineer and experienced graphic designer based in Denver, with roots in Arkansas, New Mexico, Florida and Switzerland. Grace is available to provide assistance in web and graphic design, photography and branding. <a href="contact.html">Get in touch!</a></p>

      <p>Grace has an innate understanding of and love for people, thanks in large part to her degree in Anthropology.         This is also part of why she decided to go to coding bootcamp at the University of Denver (not many people hiring Anthropologists these days). She also has a background in Buddhist and yogic studies and wants to go snowboarding with you!</p>
